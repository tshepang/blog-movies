overly complex action sequences
===============================

I am a fan of action sequences in movie, but only if the complexity is
kept to some limit. Too often, A-class movies add a lot of complexity
to the mix, as if that equates to excellence, or increases chances of
selling more tickets. Here's examples from the most guilty:

#. The Adventures Of Tintin - The Secret Of The Unicorn
#. The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey
