overly complex action sequences
===============================

I am a fan of action sequences in movie, but only if the complexity is
kept to some limit. Too often, A-class movies add a lot of complexity
to the mix, as if that equates to excellence, or increases chances of
selling more tickets. Here's examples from the most guilty:

#. `The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn`__
#. `The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey`__
