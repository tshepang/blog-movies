Elysium (2013)

It is an entertaining movie, but lacks a well-developed story and
characters. Not even the acting is satisfactory, bar that of Matt
Damon (lead character) and `William Fichtner`__ (his boss). The
actions of the violent villains are not justified, and so are those of
the Jodie Foster villain. The leader of the revolutionry criminals is
very unconvincing. The movie also feels rushed. It's a pity because it
starts well, and is well-made (the director made `District 9`__ after
all), complete with great visual effects and action direction.
