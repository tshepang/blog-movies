Elysium (2013)

It is an entertaining movie, but lacks a well-developed story and
characters. Not even the acting is satisfactory, bar that of Matt
Damon (lead character) and `William Fichtner`__ (his boss). The
violent villain is given an interesting performance, but his actions
aren't justified, and so are those of the Jodie Foster villain. The
leader of the revolutionry criminals is very unconvincing. The movie
also feels rushed. It's a pity because it starts well, and is
well-made (the director made `District 9`__ after all), complete with
great visual effects, and an appealing story.
