Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
==================================

Robert Downey Jr. is a lot of fun to watch and so is Stephen Fry, who
plays the most interesting character in the movie. I also enjoyed
`Jared Harris`__, whose villain character is offers superb rivalry
with that of the lead. It's my most favorite of his performances
(though I wish his character didn't sing). Also, I have never seen
`Kelly Reilly`__ this desirable. The visual effects are at time
eye-popping (see the escape from the military).  It's fun watching
Sherlock do his impossible deductions.

Some tiny problems:

- This may be a fantasy, but the action is too unrealistic.
- Jude Law is not so interesting, and felt a bit miscast.
- The gypsy sister kept hanging around seemingly without much purpose
  really, and the story involving her and her brother were not so
  interesting.

I enjoyed the movie a lot better than its predecessor, and it's even
better on a revisit.
