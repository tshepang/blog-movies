It's nothing new,
but it was fun watching `Kristen Wiig`__ oogle over `Chris Hemsworth`__.
I also enjoyed the nerdy performance of `Neil Casey`__,
who plays the villain,
and I wish he got more screen time.
There is also a brief performance by the ever-flawless `Charles Dance`__.
My most favorite though is the super-fresh one of `Leslie Jones`__,
