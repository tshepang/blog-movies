Network (1976)
==============

Here's what I wrote in 2009:

    For a strong satire like *Network*, complete with powerful
    appearances by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, one tends to wish
    the entire thing was shot and edited at least as well as it's
    mightier counterpart, `Dr. Strangelove`__. It's got quite some
    heavy-handed dialog that may have inspired the superior and much
    younger *Good Night & Good Luck*. What's also commendable is that
    the one voice of sane reason actually is offered by a man who is
    likely more cruel than all others in the story (bar those in the
    last meeting of course, a moment which would be a spoiler if
    revealed).

A revisit, as usual, didn't impress as much. I still appreciate the
humor and satire, but the fact that it made me feel asleep is not a
good thing. I didn't even enjoy the two performances I so praised
above. I don't even remember who I was referring to by *one voice of
sane reason*, but I do celebrate that very last scene, the meeting.
