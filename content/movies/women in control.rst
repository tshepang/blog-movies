women in control
================

:tags: list



This might make me sexist in the eyes of some, singling out women like
this, but I often find it kool seeing women in control. Maybe that's
because it's such a rare sight. Anyways, following is a list of female
characters I celebrate, either due to skill or power:

* Viola Davies as the mayor (`Law Abiding Citizen`_)
* Anjelina Jolie as the assassin (Salt_)
* Antje Traue as second-in-command of Zod (`Man of Steel`_)
* Jolianne Moore as FBI agent (*Next*)
* Michael Hyatt as detective (Nightcrawler_)
