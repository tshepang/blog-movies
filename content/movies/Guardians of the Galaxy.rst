The most interesting performance was that by Chris Pratt, who plays the lead.
I also enjoyed watching the tree-like humanoid,
the heavily-tattooed brute (amazing make-up), the very desirable servant of the
Collector, and Michael Rooker (playing the leader of the bandits).
My favorite character design is the lead villain,
though I with the mud on the face was explained.
I also wish his was a more convincing... there wasn't proper
motivation for this evil acts.

The whole thing is a lot more wacky than I expected, and does not fit
its epic name. It has lots of humor, and is very entertaining,
but I wish it was less of a passive movie. It also doesn't offer
anything new, and the visual effects are merely decent... nothing
ground-breaking here.
