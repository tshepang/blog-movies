The Illusionist (2010)
======================

It starts impressively well (the backstage, complete with the bony lady)
but soon devolves into a drag that doesn't really go anywhere. The
direction is good, and the lead character superbly-developed. It's just
not a match for the director's earlier masterful `Triplets of
Belleville`__.
