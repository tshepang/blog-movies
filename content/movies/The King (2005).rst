The King (2005)
===============

There is no shortage of good performances (I enjoyed watching the
sweet `Pell James`__ and the beautiful `Laura Harring`__, but none was
nearly as good as `Paul Dano`__). That and a strange and unpredictable
(and often edgy) script, as well as the excellent direction (check for
example the long shot near the end) makes for a very good watch.

It would have been nice if the villainous behavior of one of the
characters was explained, or the ending not leave me speculating.
