Good Night, and Good Luck (2005)
================================

Here's what a revisit felt like, back in 2010:

    It didn't pack as much of a punch as before. It even felt barren.

I was hoping that the third viewing would be more pleasant, but is
still the same as the second. It is sad because I really enjoyed this
on first viewing. It remains an important movie of course.
