Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer
==================================

A very enjoyable story with some very interesting performances, most
notably that of `Tom Towles`__, who plays a rather disgusting
character, Otis. AFAIR, this is the only one of his performances I
ever enjoyed, and he's just perfect. `Michael Rooker`__ is also a joy
to watch, and despite his incredible cruelty, remains a guy we all
care for, perhaps due to his care for the (delightful) leading lady.
