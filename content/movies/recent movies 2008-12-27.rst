A second look at *The Dark Knight* wasn't favorable, all but:

-  Heath Ledger's The Joker, the year's performance
-  the bank robbery in an early scene

Not even the action saves the movie, which was mostly wasted cash since
it ain't really good. And the last scene really is unbearable. And who
gives a shit about the cheap philosophical blah `I so previously
cherished`_.
