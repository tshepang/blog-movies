==========

When the movie does not take shortcuts with the story (the villain is
too skilled in science/engineering and also too strong; the Don
Cheadle character was able to use the suit without training), or being
annoyingly-stupid (why the fuck did Pepper Potts drive with bodyguard
to deliver the suit), it gets the delightful direction and dialog of
`its predecessor`__. The rivalry between Stark and Hammer lots of fun
to watch. The villain is also fun to watch, even though his
motivations were given lazy treatment. All three are given very good
performances.
