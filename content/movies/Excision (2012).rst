Excision (2012)

There is `a good review`__ about this, a movie that starts with more
promise than it delivers. The imagery is provocative, but not really
shocking. The movie done and written quite well, complete with quality
performances, my favorite of which is that of the lead. She's also
damn beautiful, though nearly as much as the gal across the
street... wow! The ending is a let-down... too unrealistic.

I liked this bit in `another quality review`__, which will become
relevant one you are done watching:

   ...she's quickly blossoming into quite the amateur surgeon.
