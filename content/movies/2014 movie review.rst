performances
------------

My **favorite performance** is by `Laurence R. Harvey`__ as the disgusting
(and evil) security guard in `The Human Centipede 2`_.
However, here are the **best male performances**:

#. `Michael Shannon`__ in `The Iceman`_
#. Anthony Hopkins in `Red 2`_
#. `Tom Wilkinson`__ in `Good People`_
#. Geoffrey Rush in `The Book Thief`_
#. Michael Shannon (repeat appearance) in `Premium Rush`_
#. Brad Pitt in `The Counselor`_

The **best female performance** was given by `Susanne Lothar`__ in
`Funny Games`_, followed by `Julia Louis-Dreyfus`__ in `Enough Said`_.
In third place is Emily Watson in `The Book Thief`_.

characters
----------

In terms of **character development**, nothing beats `Enough Said`_.

My **favorite character** is the adoptive father in `The Book Thief`_,
played by Geoffrey Rush, who is as loving as any character I've seen
in movies. He's followed by the charming China Doll in *Oz the Great
and Powerful*, which is about as cute and lovable as characters get.
In third place is Valka,
the mother of the lead character in `How To Train Your Dragon 2`_.

villain

**desirable gal** `Dania Ramirez`__ in `Premium Rush`_

There was no better **character design** than the giant samurai robot
in `The Wolverine`_.
In second place is the Alpha dragon from `How To Train Your Dragon 2`_.


perfect gentleman

comic

The best **script/dialogue** can be found in `Enough Said`_.

innovative

narration

sound

The following have the best **story concept**:

#. `Upside Down`_
#. `In Time`_
#. `The Adjustment Bureau`_
#. `Her`_
#. `The Purge: Anarchy`_
#. `13 Sins`_

most important

first-time viewing experience

worst revisit

make-up

overrated

original story

There was no greater **spectacle** than `Edge of Tomorrow`_.

painful

funny

enchanting

bizarre

**wtf**: the guy who directed a very unimpressive `The Butler`_ is the
same one who made Precious_, which `one of the best movies in
history`__. WTF happened there!
