performances
------------

My **favorite performance** is by `Laurence R. Harvey`__ as the disgusting
(and evil) security guard in `The Human Centipede 2`_.
However, the **best male performance** is by `Michael Shannon`__ in `The Iceman`_
followed by Anothony Hopkins in `Red 2`_. In third place is Michael
Shannon (again) in `Premium Rush`_, and fourth place is Brad Pitt in
`The Counselor`_.

The **best female performance** was given by `Susanne Lothar`__ in
`Funny Games`_, followed by `Julia Louis-Dreyfus`__ in `Enough Said`_.

characters
----------

In terms of **character development**, nothing beats `Enough Said`_.

My **favorite character** is the charming China Doll in *Oz the Great and
Powerful*; it's about as cute and lovable as the newborn baby in *Men
In Black*.

villain

**desirable gal** `Dania Ramirez`__ in `Premium Rush`_

**character design**: giant samurai robot in `The Wolverine`_
