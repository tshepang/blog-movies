performances
------------

My **favorite performance** is by `Laurence R. Harvey`__ as the disgusting
(and evil) security guard in `The Human Centipede 2`__.
However, the **best male performance** is by `Michael Shannon`__ in `The Iceman`_

Shannon (again) in `Premium Rush`_, and fourth place is Brad Pitt in
`The Counselor`_.

My **favorite character** is the charming China Doll in *Oz the Great and
Powerful*; it's about as cute and lovable as the newborn baby in *Men
In Black*.

**desirable gal** `Dania Ramirez`__ in `Premium Rush`_

**character design**: giant samurai robot in `The Wolverine`_

perfect gentleman
