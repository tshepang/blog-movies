2013 movie review
=================

:date: 2014-02-23



Not such a great year at the movies, even worse than `last year`__,
though I think I also watched a lot less movies. Luckily there's two
excellent ones, the best being `In Bruges`_. It also boasts the year's
best **direction**, **cinematography**, and **script/dialog**. The
other excellent movie is Redbelt_.


visuals
-------

Cleanskin_ has the best **action**, while `Man of Steel`_ has the
best **action sequence**, the first battle with
second-in-command of Zod.  The best **visual effects** can be found
in `Man of Steel`_, followed by Elysium_.


performances
------------

My **favorite performance** is that of Tom Towles playing Otis in
`Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer`_, but the **best male
performance** is by `Chiwetel Ejiofor`_ as an instructor in
Redbelt_. The **best female performance** is by Charlotte Rampling in
Cleanskin_.


characters
----------

My **favorite character** is the honorable martial arts instructor in
Redbelt_, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. The most **desirable gal** is
the love interest in `In Bruges`_.

The best **character design** is the fearsome The Missionary in
`Silent Hill: Revelation`_, followed by the bizarre floating giants in
MirrorMask_.


miscellaneous
-------------

The most **important** movie is `The Thaw`_ due to its well-delivered
story, which is related to the consequences of global warming. There
is a tie for the most **bizarre** movie: `Cloud Atlas`_ and
MirrorMask_.

The most **innovative** movie is the satirical `Goodbye Uncle Tom`_:
it's shot like a documentary in which the makers travel to a
particularly horrid moment in United States history, yet treating it
with humor... very daring.

The title for **best 'old' movie experience** goes to Payback_. This a
title for a movie I've seen before this year. A special mention should
go to the `Director's Cut version`__, which I saw first time
in 2013.
