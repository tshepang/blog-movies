Now You See Me (2013)
=====================

A ridiculous plot twist (I do not mind being fooled, but this is going
too far), some smart-ass characters (I don't mind such, but this also
goes too far, or maybe they are just not well-written), and an
uninteresting back-story stop this one from being more than a cheap
fantasy-thriller. Luckily it's very entertaining, and got decent
performances, not to mention an extra-desirable police lady.
