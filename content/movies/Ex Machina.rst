Fascinating, with an eery feel that's accentuated by the overly loud
and uncomfortable score, it also possesses wonderful direction and dialog.
Performances are also good, most impressive of which is the lead, though
`Sonoya Mizuno`__, playing food/sex servant, offered the most pleasure
to the eye, especially when dancing. She's so perfect.
