Avengers: Age of Ultron
=======================

I am afraid that the producers of the franchise are losing the plot a
little (I prefer `the original`__). The movie is entertaining enough,
but I kept feeling it's too
much of a money-making machine. The plot is rather messy, the action
overly-frantic, but the visual effects are great.

My favorite moment is the battle between Hulk and the super-sized Iron
Man, and what makes it extra special is the setting... South Africa.
