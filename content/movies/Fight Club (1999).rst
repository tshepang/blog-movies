What would one say when reviewing what one considers superior to all
other works of its kind? Following is a (lacklustre) attempt.

The movie remains engaging after all these years and repeat viewings
(maybe 10 times). If feels modern as any movie made today, all except
for the lack of cellphones, and a presence of a CRT television set.

It's not perfect, and I wish to see something to dethrone it. Here's
what I don't like:

* Tyler Durden manages to stand up after a bullet makes it through
  his throat. He can even talk normal, and gives a comfortable hug.

* The beating Tyler gets near the end feels so needless, and it's not
  even interesting, to make up for its uselessness, same as the
  beating Tyler gives himself in front of his boss.

I like everything else, and no movie has superior direction,
production design, and cinematography. The cast is great too and so is
the editing.
