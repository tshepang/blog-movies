The Family (2013)
=================

The two kids are a lot more interesting than the parents in this dark
comedy about a troublesome family that finds itself under witness
protection. It's well-made (and well-shot) but not very
well-written. The over-the-top actions of the family are supposed to
be funny, but fall flat, and I don't like how their cruelty is
downplayed.

I also feel Robert De Niro, the guy that gave `the best performance in
history`__, should have retired over a decade ago. He hasn't done
anything worthy of his skills, and is not interesting enough to keep
me interested. Or maybe he's just overrated, and incapable of doing
anything beyond his usual bad guy persona. He's boring, though the
movie isn't.
