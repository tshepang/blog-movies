First review:

    It has a similar feel to *Taken* and is also set in dark Europe
    and stars the very capable Liam Neeson. The storyline is solid and
    so is the acting. There is a lack of gloss, and it's very
    edgy. The twist is pretty good and so is the action, although it's
    not kool when you see an untrained person suddenly capable of
    driving a car like a stuntman.  Writers this good could have come
    up with something better.

It feels a lot worse, which is yet another instance of `The case of
'The Matrix Reloaded'`__. It's not as interesting, it does not feel
like *Taken*, is not set in dark Europe, the twist not too
interesting, and the untrained life-saver merely irritating.
