The History of Future Folk (2012)
=================================

Unique, and often dull, the movie has the lead telling a story of his
alien origins, which is so ludicrous everyone thinks is just made-up
as part of his entertainment set. This character is played by a
gorgeous Jet Li lookalike, who is a pleasure to the eye. The other
alien that later befriends him is fun to watch, and the female police
officer is pretty as fuck.
