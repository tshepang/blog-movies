Possibly the most violent movie I've yet seen, this is made in the
style of video game first person shooters. I enjoyed the wonderful
performances: the villain was especially menacing, and the guide,
given multiple characters, was given an excellent performance by
`Sharlto Copley`__, in what is his most satisfying work since
`District 9`__. The story is also fascinating and so is the
technology.
