Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
==========================================

Far superior to `the disgusting original`__, this one is even better
than `The Avengers`__, even without Hulk and Iron Man. The action
sequences are intense, though excessive (think *The Transformers*),
but not too frantic. My favorite action sequence is the Fury
chase. The abilities of the Winter Soldier matched that of Captain
America, making him fun to watch. I would have done with the flying
guy, who happens to be overly skillful, like he was some super-human,
which he's not. Same applies to the Black Widow character. The story
is okay but does not rise above the feeling that it attempts nothing
other than keep the franchise going. There's lots of shortcuts, and
not much depth.
