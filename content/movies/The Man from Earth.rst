The Man from Earth

For a movie that is almost entirely made of dialog, this is
exciting. It's also the first time I saw the `Tony Todd`__ play an
ordinary character, which he does very well.

I wish there would be more restraint: there overreaction by some of
the characters was ludicrous and felt forced, and the Jesus part even
worse.
