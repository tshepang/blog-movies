Cloverfield (2008)
==================

`I once compared this movie with I Am Legend`__, and I then I had
the following to say later that year:

   A revisit of *Cloverfield* wasn't as much a let-down as that of `I
   Am Legend`__ and am even tempted that it's so far the year's
   greatest achievement in visual effects. I just want more of that
   fabulous monster, and hopefully in a really good sequel. Perhaps an
   equally good sequel would be another discovered tape, maybe with a
   bigger budget.  Here's me salivating on what could be an extremely
   satisfying franchise.  I just so much wish no one will fuck up the
   idea.

All the above are still accurate, except I didn't enjoy the plot as
much this (third) time around. The setup was okay, all but the romance
part of it, which just felt tired. I also found it far-fetched to have
the guy brave the monsters to go rescue gal, and managing to drag
around two more people on his quest onto a heavily-compromised
building, up dozens of stairs, all to find a gal heavily injured, yet
managing to run around for several minutes on end... makes me sad :(

I enjoyed `this review`__.
