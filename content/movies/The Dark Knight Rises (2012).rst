The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
============================

I am in love with the voice and utterances of Bane, a physically
formidable villain in a mask. The movie is far bigger and more intense
than `the immediate predecessor`__. I also found it more entertaining
(at least on first viewing), and a lot less annoying, though nothing
matches the miracle that is Heath Ledger's The Joker. The title
character sounds unconvincing with the silly voice, and movie feels
like a mess. Maybe it's just too long, and the writers too desperate
to impress. The stupid twist didn't help.
