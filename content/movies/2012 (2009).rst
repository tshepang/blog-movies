I don't remember a movie whose visual effects are of this scale, and
only those of *King Kong* `are superior`__. The early scenes are much
fun, with nice superficial touches reminiscent of
`Transformers`__. The whole thing is dragged by some family drama as
well as an uninteresting John Cusack. Me loves the designs of the
arks. The 'chase' scenes, all an excuse to showcase the
extravaganza that is the effects, are pure fun. I also enjoyed the
large Russian billionaire, an otherwise unconvincing buffoon that
offers much comic relief.
