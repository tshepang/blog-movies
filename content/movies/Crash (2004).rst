I saw this first time some years ago, and it remains a quality
movie. Pity that it doesn't quite reach the levels it attempted
to. It's well-made of course, with some decent performances. I just
don't know what the point of it all is. For example, it sounds like
someone was desperate to have us look at the other side of the racist
police officer. It's likely so we see him not as one-dimensional. It
felt a little desperate. Also, why have the robber get shot by the
good cop? Anyways, I did like the prelude to the first robbery
scene. It was quite surprising what it led to.
