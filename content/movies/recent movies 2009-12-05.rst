I don't remember a movie whose visual effects are of the scale of
*2012*, and only *King Kong*'s `are superior`_; The early scenes are
much fun, with nice superficial touches reminiscent of `Transformers`_;
The whole thing is dragged by some family drama as well as an
uninteresting John Cusack; Me loves the designs of the arks, and the
'chase' scenes, all an excuse to showcase the extravaganza that is the
effects, are pure fun. I nearly forgot to mention how much I like the
large Russian billionaire, an otherwise unconvincing buffoon that offers
much comic relief.
