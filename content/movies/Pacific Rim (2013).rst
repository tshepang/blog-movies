Pacific Rim (2013)
==================

For a movie this expensive, I found none of the visual effects
impressive. Not even the designs, both creature and mechanical,
deserve applause. The battles were entertaining, but too erratic
(another case of fucks-goin-on). The story concept is retarded, making
it a blatant excuse to put giant robots on screen who didn't happen to
be the Transformers. I also wish there was an explanation for the
whole thing, beyond the too-brief and non-sensical alien invasion
explanation. Not one performance was beyond average, nor any
of the humor effective.

So, is there anything to celebrate here? Well... it's not boring.
