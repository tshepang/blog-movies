Stand Off (2013)
================

Nice performance by Brendan Fraser as the lead, and an even better one
by the guy playing the villain. The film is quite enjoyable (not a
boring moment) and the romance beautiful. I don't remember a woman
fearing her own child as is the case with mother of gangster. Good
direction and acting there.

`This quality review`__ was not as positive.
