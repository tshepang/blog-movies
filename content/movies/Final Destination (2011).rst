Final Destination (2011)
========================

:tags: 2013-movie, decent



I liked a few things:

* The bridge sequence is a showcase of decent visual effects
* The massage lady gives a quality performance, though brief
* The homage paid to `the first movie`__ in the franchise is very welcome,
  almost iconising it
* The lead actor is damn beautiful and also not boring

The movie is sadly not offering anything new, and the sudden murderous
behavior of one of the survivors serious stupid... very
unconvincing. I did like the performance of Tony Todd, though it was
laughably creepy... stupid.
