Enough Said (2013)
==================

The lead gives an amazing and charming performance, while also feels
believable. James Gandolfino is impressive too, and also
believable. The direction and editing are wonderful, all so smooth and
out of the way, focusing very much on the characters. It's all blessed
with an amazing script, a rather unusual story (fresh), quality humor,
and one of the best on-a-date moments in movie memory.

The issue with it is that the second half doesn't feel as solid as the
first, and the whole thing doesn't look like it has good re-watch
value. It feels more like (a really good) TV series, something like
*Girls*.

It was an interesting discovery that the director responsible for this
one (Nicole Holofcener) also made two other movies I love: *Friends
With Money* and `Please Give`__. For that reason, they deserve a
revisit, more so than this one :)
