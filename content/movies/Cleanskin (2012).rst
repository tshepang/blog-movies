This would have been excellent had it not dwelled so much on the
terrorist guy. I did find his appearance refreshing at first
(a fresh and beautiful face, and a solid performance),
but he's simply not lead character material.
This is unlike the Sean Bean character,
who gives a very fitting character and performance.

The first several moments are entrancing,
and compete favorably in terms of execution (and grit) against far
more expensive productions like those in the `Bourne series`__.

The one weak spot in the movie is the beheader character.
He was supposed to be menacing and heartless,
but he looks more fit for a lesser movie,
and the moment involving the baby was simply needless.
Luckily there is no shortage of superb acting,
most notably from the lady in charge, `Charlotte Rampling`__.
