Goodbye Bafana (2007)
=====================

Watching `Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom`__ led me to check this one,
whose existence I've been ignoring a few years now. Sadly, I have to
say I didn't miss much... It's as dull they come, and none of the
elements are worthy of celebration (cinematography, direction, acting,
script, ...). The concept of exploring the life of an icon through
someone else's eyes is something I appreciated about *Cry Freedom*,
but then it helped that someone else actually was heroic, making him
interesting. It's not the case here. As for the lead, it doesn't look
like much effort was expended really; not even an attempt to make him
look older, beyond some white shit on his head. WTF!
