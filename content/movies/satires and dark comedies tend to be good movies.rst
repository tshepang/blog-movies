It's probably hard to make dark comedies and satires, discouraging most
artists to make them. Many satires tend to be dark comedies, that's why
I chose to make this one post.

Anyways here's a list of works of excellent works that fit the bill:

- Bamboozled
- `Being John Malkovich`__
- `Dr. Strangelove`__
- Fight Club
- `Lord of War`__
- Network__
- Payback__
- `Requiem for A Dream`__
