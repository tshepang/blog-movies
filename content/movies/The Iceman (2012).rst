`Michael Shannon`__ gives an excellent and unusual performance as a
fearsome contract killer, in a movie with excellent cinematography and
production design, and excellent writing. Another notable performance
is that of `Ray Liotta`__, even though he plays his usual character,
only this time I really enjoyed him, perhaps even more than in
`Smokin' Aces`__. There is not one other performance that is lacking,
and even `Chris Evans`__ helped by hiding his not-too-talented face
behind a large beard.
