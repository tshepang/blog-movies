2012-10-21 review:

    Real nice camerawork and direction; very interesting performances.
    The brutal acts of the criminal are sadly left
    unjustified/unexplained.

I still feel the same, surprisingly, but I neglected to mention my
favorites: the driver, the court snitch, the private investigator (the
ever-excellent William H. Macy), and the desirable female detective.
