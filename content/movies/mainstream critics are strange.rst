mainstream critics are strange
==============================

:date: 2014-03-21



Following is my experiences of movies on the `Sight & Sound list`_ of
the 10 greatest movies ever made:

I've seen the overrated *Citizen Kane* and slept through the *2001: A
Space Odyssey*. I did not find anything particularly exceptional about
`Tokyo Story`_, and *The Searchers* does not deserve to be mentioned
(except maybe for the lead's surprising non-angelic persona,
which gives him some complexity). I did not
notice a single thing special about *Vertigo*, which made it more shocking given
that the critics regarded it the greatest movie ever made!
It was even more perplexing to find anyone honoring Rashomon_ at all.
Of all those I've seen, the only one I actually like is `The
Passion of Joan of Arc`__
