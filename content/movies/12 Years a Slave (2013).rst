12 Years a Slave (2013)
=======================

I expected a lot more, and got disappointed by the
less-than-impressive direction and script. Not even Chiwetel Ejiofor
saves it, and he in fact exposes his limitations as an actor, which is
sad given I am something of a fan... see him in Redbelt__ and *Four
Brothers* for example.

The one interesting subplot is one involving the sex pet, whose fate
is less than desirable. Not that her performance is any excellent, nor
her scenes particularly well-made. She just happens to be in a rather
unique situation, and I like her face :)

This may end up the most overrated movie of the year. There's not much
value in here. Find something else. If in a mood for some Black
American slavery stuff, check out the far superior Mandingo__ and
`Goodbye Uncle Tom`__, or even `Django Unchained`__.
