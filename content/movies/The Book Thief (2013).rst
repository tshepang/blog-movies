The Book Thief (2013)
=====================

Geoffrey Rush gives a very touching performance as kindly guardian of
a girl who lost her family. He is as loving a character as I've seen
in movies. Emily Watson also shines as the angry wife. Both
performances are flawless, and the movie feels like a weird and horrid
fable. It's not a pleasant watch, especially the second half.
