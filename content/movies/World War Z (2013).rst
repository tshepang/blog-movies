World War Z (2013)
==================

The family-focus thing is boring, and so is the overly-heroic antics
of the not-so-interesting lead. The story also feels incomplete, and
I've seen superior treatment of `the subject matter`__.

On a more positive note, I have never seen zombies so vicious. Also,
the movie not boring.
