2015 review
===========

:tags: year-review, 2015



The best **visual effects** can be found in the Hulk vs. Iron Man battle
of `Avengers: Age of Ultron`_. Runner-up is the title character of Chappie_.
The greatest **spectacle** is `Jurassic World`_, whose visual effects
aren't shabby either.

My **favorite performance** is that of Benedict Wong in `The Martian`_,
while my **favorite villain** is Scarlet, the lead villain of
`Minions`_. That movie also boasts best **visual design**.
The most **desirable gal** is Sonoya Mizuno in `Ex Machina`_, which
also happens to have the **best dialog**.
