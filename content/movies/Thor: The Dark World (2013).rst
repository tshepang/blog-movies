Thor: The Dark World (2013)
===========================

An improvement over `the original`__, it has far superior visual
effects (the evil dark energy and the epic duels), a far more
interesting villain, and superior character design.
Sadly, we are still stuck with two very uninteresting characters:
those played by Natalie Portman (the stale love interest)
and `Kat Dennings`__ (the unfunny comic relief).
