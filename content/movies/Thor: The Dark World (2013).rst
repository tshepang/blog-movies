Thor: The Dark World (2013)
===========================

An improvement over `the original`__, it has far superior visual
effects (the evil dark energy and the epic duels), a far more
interesting villain, and superior character design. There is still the
uninteresting and stale Natalie Portman character
and the never-serious sidekick.
