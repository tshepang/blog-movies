Thor: The Dark World (2013)
===========================

:date: 2014-03-10
:tags: 2014-movie, good



An improvements over `the original`__, it has far superior visual
effects (the evil dark energy and the epic duels), and a far more
interesting villain, and superior character design. There is still the
uninteresting Natalie Portman character (not charming, and too stale)
and the never-serious sidekick.
