================================

The are three performances that stand out:

* Forest Whitaker gives `the best one of his career`__ playing the title
  character. His is also a very well-developed character.

* James McAvoy gives an excellent one as the advisor, though his
  character is not very fresh... tis been done before.

* Kerry Washington is both a desirable and very capable actor, and
  there isn't a lack of those two qualities here.

The movie is very well-made, complete with quality production design
and an interesting story.
