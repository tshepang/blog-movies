my movie rating system
======================

:tags: untagged


Here is what I mean by the rating tags:

* A **landmark** is any movie I would give 10/10;
  so far I don't have any, closest being `Fight Club`__.

* Following is the rest:

  * 9/10 **masterpiece**
  * 8/10 **excellent**
  * 7/10 **very good**
  * 6/10 **good**
  * 5/10 **decent**
  * 4/10 **average**
  * 3/10 **substandard**
  * 2/10 **near-trash**
