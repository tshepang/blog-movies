The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)
======================================

:date: 2014-02-20
:tags: average, 2014-movie



More bearable than `the first movie`__, with amazing visual designs:
check the Rome-like arena and the city. Not much else is interesting,
least of which is the soppy romance. The twist is lack-lustre, and the
leading lady remains unconvincing.
