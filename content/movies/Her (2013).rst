Her (2013)

The movie is beautifully-shot, well-written, and has an exciting
concept. The experience of the first 30 minutes or so was so magical
that I was led to think this may turn out to be the best movie I saw
first time in 2014. Sadly that wasn't the case: feels like the writer
didn't know where to take the story, or even how to end it. The
direction style feels similar to `Tree of Life`__, only a lot less
experimental, and a lot more entertaining.

My favorite performance is that of Olivia Wilde. I've only enjoyed her
once before, `In Time`__, and I've seen her in a few other places as
well, most notably the good-to-excellent TV series, *House*. In all
that, she has never been this good (see the heartbreak moment), and
this desirable. It's also a brief performance, a fact that's probably
in her favor, given she's not the most excellent of actors.
