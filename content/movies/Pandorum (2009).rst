Very nice production and creature design, although both these elements
have been copied (inspired) from elsewhere. The whole thing is rather
disturbing though (`Ben Foster`__ is an intense actor; the sound
effects were extremely loud; the sounds made by the creatures didn't
help either). It's edge-of-your-seat stuff, with horrid enemies all
over.
