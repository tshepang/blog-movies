tough women
===========

:tags: list



It's such a rare sight seeing tough gals in movies. When such
characters are developed and/or performed well, I always celebrate.

Here goes:

* Viola Davies as the mayor (`Law Abiding Citizen`_)
* Angelina Jolie as the assassin (Salt_)
* Antje Traue as second-in-command of Zod (`Man of Steel`_)
* Julianne Moore as FBI agent (*Next*)
* Michael Hyatt as detective (Nightcrawler_)
