Red 2 (2013)
============

A lot more enjoyable than `its predecessor`__, it has one amazing
performance by Anthony Hopkins in a rather fitting role. Luckily his
talent wasn't wasted here as was the case in the two super-hero
movies, Thor__ and `Thor: The Dark World`__. I also enjoyed watching
the Asian guy (he looks lethal), as well as the romantic antics of the
female assassin (Helen Mirren) and his Russian lover.

The plot of the movie is complicated and some of the humor works (see
the Helen Mirren paying with her feet while unleashing her violence).
But the movie is too much of a fantasy, and is way too loud. Some of
it was good though, and my favorite was the first, in which the hero
escapes from some especially unfeeling government agent.
