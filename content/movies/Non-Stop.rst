Liam Neeson gets to be tough guy nearly as impressive as his character
in Taken__, and in a movie nearly as hard-biting. One other impressive
performance is that of the Black cellphone guy; his incredible
transformation near the end of the movie is exciting. The movie also
has some of the best action sequences I've seen yet.

I wish the acts
of the villain were given more justification though... he wasn't
convincing when he claimed that the hero wasn't heroic enough.
